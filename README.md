I am a student majoring in data science, University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City National University. 
This project was done by me alone and was carried out in the second semester of my first year of university.
This project is to develop an AI bot (I built on some pre-built libraries) to recognize emotions in comments, then classify them into negative, positive or neutral emotions. 
NLP application is oriented in filtering offensive comments on social networks, a feature that Tiktok is also currently applying.
